# Documentation and Use Case
"""
creation and training of a simple feed-forward neural network using PyTorch.
PyTorch is a popular deep learning framework that provides flexibility and ease of use for building and training neural networks.

Use Case:
- The network is designed to classify input data into one of two classes.
- It uses a single fully connected layer with 10 input features and 2 output classes.
- The script includes a forward pass, loss computation, and a backward pass for optimization.

Key PyTorch Components Used:
1. `torch.nn`: Provides modules and classes for building neural networks (e.g., `nn.Linear`, `nn.CrossEntropyLoss`).
2. `torch.optim`: Contains optimization algorithms (e.g., `optim.Adam`).
3. `torch.Tensor`: Represents multi-dimensional arrays for input data and model parameters.
