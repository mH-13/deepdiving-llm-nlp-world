### **4. LLM Fine-tuning & Benchmarking**

#### **4.1 Fine-tuning LLMs**

**Explanation**:  
Fine-tuning adapts a pre-trained LLM (e.g., GPT-3, BERT) to a specific task (e.g., medical text classification) by training it on a smaller, task-specific dataset.

**Steps**:

1. **Load Pre-trained Weights**:
   ```python
   from transformers import BertForSequenceClassification
   model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
   ```
2. **Add Task-Specific Layers**:
   - Example: Add a classification head on top of BERT.
3. **Train on Custom Data**:
   - Freeze early layers, train only the new head (optional).

**Example**:  
Fine-tuning BERT on IMDb movie reviews for sentiment analysis.

#### **4.2 Benchmarking LLMs**

**Explanation**:  
Benchmarking evaluates model performance using standardized tasks/metrics.

**Common Benchmarks**:

- **GLUE**: General Language Understanding Evaluation (e.g., sentence similarity).
- **SQuAD**: Question answering.
- **WMT**: Machine translation.

**Multilingual Challenges**:

- **Data Scarcity**: Low-resource languages (e.g., Bengali) lack training data.
- **Cross-Lingual Transfer**: Using a model trained on English to perform tasks in Spanish.

**Example**:

- mBERT (multilingual BERT) is benchmarked on XNLI for cross-lingual inference.

#### **4.3 Evaluation Metrics**

**Explanation**:

- **BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)**:
  - Measures n-gram overlap between generated and reference text (used in translation).
- **ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation)**:
  - Measures recall of overlapping n-grams (used in summarization).
- **Perplexity**:
  - Measures how well a language model predicts a sample (lower = better).

**Example**:

- A translation model with BLEU=0.65 (65% n-gram overlap) is better than one with BLEU=0.5.

### **MCQs for LLM Fine-tuning & Benchmarking**

1. **What is the first step in fine-tuning an LLM?**  
   a) Train from scratch  
   b) Load pre-trained weights  
   c) Tokenize data  
   d) Add a classification head

   **Answer**: b) Load pre-trained weights  
   **Explanation**: Fine-tuning starts with a pre-trained model (e.g., BERT).

2. **Which metric is used for summarization tasks?**  
   a) BLEU  
   b) ROUGE  
   c) Perplexity  
   d) Accuracy

   **Answer**: b) ROUGE  
   **Explanation**: ROUGE evaluates recall of key phrases in summaries.

3. **Why is multilingual benchmarking challenging?**  
   a) Too much data  
   b) High computational cost  
   c) Data scarcity for some languages  
   d) Lack of metrics

   **Answer**: c) Data scarcity for some languages  
   **Explanation**: Low-resource languages lack labeled datasets for training/evaluation.
