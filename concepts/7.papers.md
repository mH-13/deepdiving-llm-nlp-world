### **Paper Summary**  
**Title**: "Unveiling Twitter Sentiments: Analyzing Emotions and Opinions through Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Dataset"  
**Objective**: Compare two sentiment analysis models (VADER and RoBERTa) to classify tweets as *positive*, *negative*, or *neutral*.  
**Key Points**:  
1. **Dataset**: 1,000 English tweets (sourced from Mendeley + manually collected), manually annotated for sentiment.  
2. **Preprocessing**: Removed noise (URLs, hashtags), retained emojis, lowercased text, eliminated repeated characters, and performed POS tagging.  
3. **Models**:  
   - **VADER**: Rule-based, lexicon-driven (good for social media text).  
   - **RoBERTa**: Transformer-based, pretrained on large datasets (better at contextual understanding).  
4. **Results**:  
   - **VADER**: Higher accuracy (92%) but struggles with sarcasm/context.  
   - **RoBERTa**: Lower accuracy (77.8%) but higher precision (86.93%).  
5. **Limitations**: Small dataset, English-only focus, challenges with sarcasm/irony, and model interpretability.

### **Topics Covered in the Paper**  
1. **Sentiment Analysis Basics**:  
   - What is sentiment analysis? Why is it useful for Twitter data?  
   - Differences between *lexicon-based* (VADER) and *machine learning-based* (RoBERTa) approaches.  

2. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Techniques: Removing noise, lowercasing, handling emojis, POS tagging.  
   - Why preprocessing matters for model performance.  

3. **Model Comparison**:  
   - **VADER**: Strengths (speed, simplicity) vs. weaknesses (misses context).  
   - **RoBERTa**: Strengths (contextual understanding) vs. weaknesses (computational cost, data hunger).  

4. **Evaluation Metrics**:  
   - Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrices.  

5. **Challenges in NLP**:  
   - Sarcasm, irony, multilingual/cultural contexts.

### **Potential Interview Questions**  
#### **Technical Questions**  
1. **Why did you choose VADER and RoBERTa for comparison?**  
   - *Assesses understanding of model tradeoffs*.  
   - **Sample Answer**: "VADER is lightweight and designed for social media, while RoBERTa offers state-of-the-art contextual analysis. We wanted to compare rule-based vs. deep learning approaches."  

2. **How did you handle emojis in preprocessing?**  
   - *Tests data cleaning strategies*.  
   - **Sample Answer**: "We retained emojis because they carry sentiment (e.g., ðŸ˜Š = positive). VADERâ€™s lexicon includes emoji sentiment scores."  

3. **Why did RoBERTa underperform despite being a advanced model?**  
   - *Probes critical analysis skills*.  
   - **Sample Answer**: "RoBERTa may need more training data or fine-tuning. Our small dataset (1,000 tweets) likely limited its performance."  

#### **Methodology & Analysis**  
4. **How did you address dataset imbalance?**  
   - *Tests data curation/annotation practices*.  
   - **Sample Answer**: "We manually annotated tweets to ensure balance across positive/negative/neutral classes."  

5. **What evaluation metric is most important for sentiment analysis?**  
   - *Evaluates grasp of metrics*.  
   - **Sample Answer**: "F1-score, as it balances precision and recall. For imbalanced data, weighted F1 is better."  

#### **Critical Thinking**  
6. **How would you improve this study?**  
   - *Assesses problem-solving and innovation*.  
   - **Sample Answer**: "Expand the dataset, include multilingual tweets, and test hybrid models (e.g., VADER + RoBERTa ensemble)."  

7. **How do you handle sarcasm in sentiment analysis?**  
   - *Tests knowledge of NLP challenges*.  
   - **Sample Answer**: "Use contextual models like RoBERTa, add sarcasm detection layers, or collect domain-specific training data."
